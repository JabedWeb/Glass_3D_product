# Sunglasses-3D

This project showcases a 3D model of sunglasses created using React Three Fiber. Customers can customize the material for the frame, frame tips, glass material, and lens color. You can view the live demo [here](https://sunglasses-3d-jabedweb.surge.sh/).

## Technologies Used

- **React Three Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics.
- **GLTF**: A file format for 3D models.
- **Blender**: A tool for creating 3D models.
